                            the murder: "Soulja's Story," from 2Pacalypse Now. Seizing on the opportunity to make a
                            statement, Vice President Dan Quayle called on Pac's record company Interscope to
                            withdraw the album, and the trooper's family sued Pac and Interscope for millions of

                            his car. An exchange of words turned into an exchange of bullets as one of the officers
                            fired at Pac's car, and Pac shot both men, only wounding them. Pac was arrested, but the
                            conduct and gun possession of the two officers were called into question, and charges
                            against all parties were eventually dropped.

                            New York hotel. The woman claimed was repeatedly raped by Tupac and his
                            crew, though Pac consistently denied the charges. “I'm young, black, and 22, and I'm
                            making money,” he told reporters about the case. “They can't find a way to make me

                            him out of Bellevue hospital the next day. But during his short time in the hospital,
                            Pac had another pivotal moment—finally meeting his father, Billy Garland. “Right then I
                            thought I had died and gone to Heaven,” Pac said of meeting Garland.

                            New York hotel. While awaiting sentencing, he spoke to Vibe's Kevin Powell. “I had a
                            job,” Pac said, “and I never showed up.” He hadn't raped the young woman, but he hadn't
                            stopped it either. “I'm going to show people my true heart,” Tupac said. “I'm
                            going to show them the man that my mother raised.” He ended up being sentenced to four
                            and a half years in the maximum-security facility at Dannemora, New York.

                            (Interscope Records ponied up most of it) to spring him while he appealed the sexual
                            abuse conviction. In return, Tupac signed a deal with Death Row that named Knight's
                            lawyer David Kenner as his legal representative and Knight himself as controller of his
                            business affairs. Pac immediately hit the studio and within six days of his release had
                            recorded 14 songs.

                            double album, All Eyez on Me. Like most double albums, it was uneven in scope, but the
                            stellar production from Dr. Dre, Daz and Devonte Swing often overshadowed what it
                            lacked, and it remains one of Pac's most revered recordings to this day. He was bigger
                            than ever, his fame cemented by the controversy of his jail stint, movie appearances,
                            simmering beef with Biggie, and ambitious album release. All Eyez on Me was his second
                            No. 1 album, and the last to be released in his lifetime.

                            M.A.F.I.A. and Lil' Kim, as well as Mobb Deep. Tupac hits low — "You claim to be a
                            player, but I fucked your wife," he says, targeting Biggie and his wife, Faith Evans. He
                            even taunts Prodigy for his sickle-cell diagnosis. If the east coast-west coast beef had
                            been smoldering before, "Hit 'Em Up" set the whole thing on fire.

                        <div class="event">Almost three months to the day after he released “Hit Em Up,” Tupac was
                            shot on the Las Vegas strip while riding with Suge Knight. There were 13 shots, and Pac
                            was hit in the hand, the pelvis and twice in the chest. While in the hospital, he woke
                            up briefly, seemingly awakened by the sound of his girlfriend Kidada's voice. Tupac
                            Amaru Shakur died on September 13, 1996. He was 25.
